%% =================== Part 6: Try Your Own Emails =====================
%  Now that you've trained the spam classifier, you can use it on your own
%  emails! In the starter code, we have included spamSample1.txt,
%  spamSample2.txt, emailSample1.txt and emailSample2.txt as examples. 
%  The following code reads in one of these emails and then uses your 
%  learned SVM classifier to determine whether the email is Spam or 
%  Not Spam

% Set the file to be read in (change this to spamSample2.txt,
% emailSample1.txt or emailSample2.txt to see different predictions on
% different emails types). Try your own emails as well!
filename = 'emailSample3.txt';

% Read and predict
file_contents = readFile(filename);
word_indices  = processEmail(file_contents);
x             = emailFeatures(word_indices);
p = svmPredict(model, x);

fprintf('\nProcessed %s\n\nSpam Classification: %d\n', filename, p);
fprintf('(1 indicates spam, 0 indicates not spam)\n\n');
